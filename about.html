                        <p>I'm currently in my third year of Computer Science Engineering at Koneru Lakshmai University in Vijayawada, maintaining a commendable CGPA of 9.22. Throughout my journey here, I've delved deep into various programming languages such as C, Java, and Python, with a foundational understanding of certain full-stack courses. Beyond academics, I've been actively involved in fostering a supportive learning environment within our department. Serving as a peer mentor and a LEAD member in the official body has not only honed my leadership skills but has also provided me with invaluable opportunities for personal and professional growth.</p>
